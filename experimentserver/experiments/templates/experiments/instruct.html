        <ul>
          <li> You will see a series of animations involving dots of different colours.
          <li> After it ends, you will be asked to report which emotion one of the dots on the screen was feeling (if you think it felt any).
          <li> You need to give your response before the timer hits zero. There are points for speed!
          <li> Most animations have been broken down into scenes. A counter on the top of the screen will notify which scene is being played, please view the scenes as part of one animation.
          <li> Your responses will be entries from 1-7 in the scale which pops up after each scene. It has a set of emotions (happy, sad, etc.) and you need to fill a value for EACH of the emotions with '1' being the lowest and '7' the highest.
          <li> Please note carefully the colour of the dot for which the emotions are being asked for. Let's start!!
